# sqlalchemy-challenge

This project analyzes 12 months of climate data from 9 different weather stations in Hawaii. This data is stored in a SQLite database. In this project I use Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy and SQLAlchemy to clean, transform and visualize the data. You will see several graphs that show precipitation over time, the summary statistics of the precipitation, as well as several visual representations of temperature over the year.
